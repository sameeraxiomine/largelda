3930271	X	"A golf glove is disclosed having an extra finger pocket between the index and middle finger pockets for securing one finger of one hand of a golf player between the fingers of the player's other hand. "
3930280	X	"Leaks are precluded in product containers with the bottle insert by structuring a rim thereon for establishing an inclined sealing interface. A diaphragm is structured within the bottle insert to provide either a cylindrical or a noncylindrical wipe over the particular type of applicator tip selected for use in the product container. Furthermore, provisions are incorporated within the bottle insert to block passage through the wiping diaphragm of misaligned comb type applicator tips and these provisions are made self-aligning for such tips with minor structural modification. "
3930299	X	"A method and apparatus for end jointing timber members such as floor or ceiling joists by means of spiked timber connector plates, using apparatus incorporating equipment to position and hold the timber and automatically feed connector plates from cassettes or magazines holding a supply of connector plates onto magnetized pressing platens which then rotate to position the connector plates to span the joint to be made before passing the spikes into the relevant timber members. "
3930307	X	"The method and apparatus includes the use of at least one pallet, an assembly line, a projector means, and an electrical testing means. Assembly of the wiring harnesses takes place on the pallets which are either independently powered or move on a powered conveyor line. In either alternative, the pallets move along a non-synchronous, power and free assembly line. An overhead projector means is provided above selected work stations to project instructions and diagrams on the pallet. Electrical testing means are used to test the wiring harnesses during assembly, prior to completion of assembly, and to control movement of the pallet to the next work station. The method includes testing partially assembled components for electrical opens, shorts and incorrectly assembled components on the pallet at intermediate stages of assembly and passing the partially assembled components to the next stage of assembly only when the components have been shown to be correctly assembled. "
3930316	X	"The rear sight of a firearm has a peephole device formed by a hollow tube, each of the two ends of which are closed by a peephole. Each peephole has a central orifice therein. The orifice of the peephole of the rear side has a larger diameter than the orifice of the peephole on the front sight side. Each peephole is pivotally mounted and cooperates with an elastic member which holds the peephole in its tube-opening or tube-closing position. In a further embodiment, two peepholes are provided at each end of the tube. "
3930325	X	"A steam iron soleplate, generator, and distributor subassembly of a thin soleplate with a coverplate spaced from and supported on the soleplate by spaced peripheral rib means to define a steam distributing passage therebetween. The coverplate is integrally attached to the soleplate by a continuous weld between the ribs and soleplate and steam generating means are provided in the upper surface of the cover-plate separate and spaced from the soleplate and ducted below to the steam passage means. A heat generating element forms an integral part of the coverplate for heat transfer to the soleplate through the ribs primarily by conduction. Both the method of assembly and the subassembly itself are disclosed. "
